# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is intended to be a study guide used by people studying web developement. When studying this topic, people are exposed to a lot of information very quickly, which can become overwhelming. By creating this webpage, I am hoping to ease some of the overwhelm by having a "cheat sheet" of key terms and definitions that someone can easily reference. In doing this, I learned that learning is not always as quick as it may seem!

## Usage

This study guide is divided into sections for ease of use. Simply find the section corresponding to the topic you are studying!

You can also right click the webpage, select "Inspect" to view the DevTools. Select "Console" on the bar at the top right to see the Javascript working. From here, a topic will also be randomly suggested for study. If that topic doesn't sound appealing at the moment, refresh your webpage, and a new topic will be suggested. If that topic still doesn't sound appealing, you may need to take a breather!
